### User Stories:
- As a user of this app, I want to be able to log in from the landing page into a profile where my reading list will be stored.
- I want to be able to seperate my books into "Read" and "To Read" categories for easy browsing, and be able to search by Author or Title.
- I want to be able to easily add, edit and delete books from my Reading List profile and be in control of which categories they are listed in.


### Developer Goals:
As a developer, I wanted to build an app that could store data for a user in regards to their reading habits. 
I want them to have a profile page which can be accessed via a login landing page and make it easy to navigate their way around adding, editing and deleting books to their reader list.
I also want the lists themselves to be displayed alphabetically in order to make it easier to find titles.
